**This repository contains scripts accompanying Cvijovic, Good, and Desai (2017) bioRxiv**

Scripts in the directory **forward_time** implement forward-time Wright-Fisher simulations of asexual populations subject to neutral and deleterious mutations.

For completeness, we also provide simulations of the structured coalescent and of the Bolthausen-Sznitzman coalescent in the directory **bacward_time/**.
